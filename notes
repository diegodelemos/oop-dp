(00) Adapter/Wrapper                     ---- Structural
     ~ Adapts interfaces.

(01) Decorator/Wrapper                   ---- Structural
     ~ Avoids Class explosion.
     ~ Runtime configuration (while
       chaning the identity of the
       objects).
     ~ Doesn't preserve object identity.
     ~ Changes the skin.

(02) Abstract Factory/Kit                ---- Creational
     ~ **Having `types` as first class
       objects**
     ~ In Python everything is a first
       class object.

(03) Template Method                     ---- Behavioural

(04) Factory Method/Virtual Constructor  ---- Creational
     ~ Typicaly done in python using
       @classmethod.

(05) Singleton                           ---- Creational
     ~ Not just having global shared
       state.
     ~ The goal is to make sure we have
       just one object instance
       i.e. printer queue, stdout.

(06) State				 ---- Behavioural
     ~ Preserves object identity.
     ~ Changes the guts.

(07) Strategy				 ---- Behavioural
     ~ **Having functions as first class
       objects.**
     ~ Out of the box in Python.

(08) Facade				 ---- Behavioural
     ~ Keep in mind it is different to
       adapter.

(09) Proxy
     ~ Remote. Faking remote object(cost)
     ~ Virtual (creation). i.e. Reading
       big files.
     ~ Copy on Write. i.e. copying a big
       object.
     ~ Caching. i.e. remember data that
       cost a lot to compute.

(10) Observer				 ---- Behavioural
     ~ Push-pull spectrum. Observer gets
       information as parameter on update
       call or he pulls info from where
       he 'knows'.
     ~ Atomicity of opeartions inside
       `subject`. Ensure consistency of
       internal state.

(11) Command				 ---- Behavioural
     ~ **Wants functions as first class
       objects.**
     ~ Hysteresis, be careful
       i.e. s = srt(2) -> s * s == 2
       Solution for this is Memento
       storing states instead of actions.
     ~ Strategy VS Command
       How	VS What
     ~ Treat functions as data.

(12) Iterator			         ---- Behavioural
     ~ External iterator. Object wraps
       original collection and provides
       fine grain control over the
       iteration process
     ~ Internal iterator. You just go
       over the iterator no care about
       reaching the end or being empty.
       For loops in python use internal
       iterators
     ~ No matter how the iteration
       process or how complex is the
       internal data structure, the
       interface for going through it
       it is always the same.

(13) Bridge			        ---- Structural
     ~ Another name:
       pimpl -> pointer to
                implementation
     ~ Avoids class explosion
       SVGDog/Man TkinterDog/Man etc..
     ~ An Abstract Factory is often
       used to create one side of a
       Bridge.
     ~ An adpter is often used on one
       side of a Bridge.
